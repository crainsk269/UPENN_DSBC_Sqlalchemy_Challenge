## UPENN_DSBC_Sqlalchemy_Challenge

##### For this challenge I reviewed all previous lectures for Module 10 Advanced SQL. I also reworked all of the classroom assignments. I used the following websites if I needed any further assistance in understanding any of the material: Pandas.Pydata.org, Stack Overflow, W3Schools, and GeeksforGeeks.org.
